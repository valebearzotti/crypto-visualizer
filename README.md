# crypto-visualizer

#### Project description:

My main idea is to manipulate data and visualize it depending on certain filters. I'm using Coinbase API for this particular project, getting all the information and filtering it for what I want to display, and formatting the charts depending on that data.

Some functionalities I want to have:

- Search for a crypto currency / view a list of them.
- On a selected crypto, display chart with options to the side. For example: display the data with spans every 5 minutes, 10, 30, etc. Another option could be to select a date span and display the values for such dates.

I add stuff when i'm bored / have some spare time.
